# Eurostat Data Wizard
A straightforward webapp to export easily multiple Eurostat datasets. You can play with a (resource limited) working version [here](https://eurostat-datawizard.streamlit.app). For a better experience, cloning the repo and run it locally is suggested.

# User guide
## Home [Optional]
1. In order to gain advanced variable search, app must create an index for Eurostat data. This step requires a considerable amount of time but should be done just once. 
2. While running, do not leave or refresh page. If connection is reset for some reason, you can resume index creation: previous API requests are cached and will be faster to process.
3. When ready, index is persisted on disk and all app users can benefit from it. Bear in mind that index can become too old but it can be refreshed. Check the displayed date to guide your choice.

## Map
An overview of every Eurostat dataset, characterized by its variables, in relation with the other. Closer the datasets, more the common variables.

## Data
1. [Optional] Filter Eurostat datasets list by a variable of interest. This option appears only if an index was created.
2. Choose an Eurostat dataset of interest (or start typing dataset code or title).
3. After loading, you can inspect the dataset and filter indexes, flags and time-span with the controls provided in the sidebar.
4. When done, you can _download_ the current data snapshot in a convenient gzipped csv. You can _stash_ it for further inspection down the line. 
5. You can repeat the process starting from _1_ for as many dataset as you like.

## Stash
Stash it's where you can find every dataset that you stored for later use. The current stash will be reported here and you can _download_ it too.

# Run the app on localhost
This is a [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)-based app. Requirements are managed with [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/).

# FAQ
## System requirements
### Package [eust](https://github.com/rasmuse/eust)
If you find this error:
```
ERROR:: Could not find a local HDF5 installation.
```
and you are on a Mac, install `hdf5` on your system using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and this command:
```
brew install hdf5
```
then add these env vars to your `.zprofile` o directly on your shell:
```
export HDF5_DIR=/opt/homebrew/opt/hdf5
export BLOSC_DIR=/opt/homebrew/opt/c-blosc
```
